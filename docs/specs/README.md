# rust-ocpp Specs

Authoritative specification of `rust-ocpp`'s behavior, split by capability area.

These files are **normative**: the code is expected to conform to them, not the
other way around. When code and spec disagree, that is a defect in one of them —
resolve it, don't paper over it.

## Areas

| Area | Covers | ID prefix |
|---|---|---|
| [`v1_6`](./v1_6/) | OCPP 1.6 messages and types | `OA-R-*` |
| [`v2_0_1`](./v2_0_1/) | OCPP 2.0.1 messages, datatypes, enumerations | `OB-R-*` |
| [`v2_1`](./v2_1/) | OCPP 2.1 messages, datatypes, enumerations (WIP) | `OC-R-*` |
| [`codegen`](./codegen/) | The schema-to-Rust generator in `codegen/` | `CG-R-*` |

Cross-cutting: [`non-functional-requirements.md`](./non-functional-requirements.md)
(`NF-R-nnn`).

## Rules for writing specs

**1. No code pointers.** Never cite `file:line`, function names, type names, or
internal identifiers. A spec states *what must be true*, not where it is
implemented — code pointers rot on every refactor and turn the authoritative doc
into a liar. The **public API is different**: exported names, signatures, error
variants, feature flags, and configuration fields are part of the contract and
*are* spec content. They belong in the area's `api-contract.md`.

**2. Requirement IDs are stable and append-only.** Each requirement carries an ID
from its area's prefix (see the table above). Never renumber. Never reuse a
retired ID. A deleted requirement's ID stays dead. Reference requirements by ID
in commits, PRs, tests, and agent instructions.

**3. Owner is the behavior, not the surface.** A configuration field is specified
with the behavior it controls, not wherever it happens to be typed in — so one
change touches one file. If two areas must behave identically, the requirement
belongs to the area that owns the shared behavior, stated once.

**4. Requirements are testable.** Write "shall" statements with observable
outcomes. "The client shall fail a request with a timeout error after the
configured response timeout elapses with no matching response" is a requirement.
"The client is robust" is not. Where a format is involved, the strongest form
names the exact bytes — here, the exact JSON field name, type and cardinality as
the official OCA schema states it.

**5. Known gaps are specified, not hidden.** Behavior that is ugly but
intentional (an unsupported case, a deliberate deviation, a missing policy)
belongs in the area's `edge-cases.md` as a stated constraint — so it is not
mistaken for an oversight and silently "fixed".

## Per-area files

Not every area needs every file; add and drop based on need.

| File | Contains |
|---|---|
| `requirements.md` | Numbered, testable "shall" statements. Every area has one. |
| `api-contract.md` | The area's stable public surface: exported names and signatures, error variants, configuration fields, feature flags. |
| `data-contract.md` | Formats: wire layouts, file schemas, field widths, ordering, ranges. |
| `edge-cases.md` | Boundary behavior, error semantics, and stated known limitations. |

## Requirements intentionally not unit-tested

Most requirements are pinned by a test whose doc comment cites the ID. A minority
are **deliberately** left without a dedicated test — they are not gaps. This list
records that decision so it is not re-discovered as one. Two kinds qualify;
nothing else does.

**1. Design-posture, platform, toolchain, and versioning statements.** These
assert facts about the build or the design, not runtime behavior a `shall` test
could observe. Each names its enforcement point instead (a CI job, a manifest
field, a lint configuration).

**2. Cross-cutting restatements whose behavior is asserted under the owning
area.** The requirement is real, but its test lives with the per-area requirement
that owns the behavior, cited by *that* ID.

Anything not listed below is expected to carry a citing test.

| Requirement | Kind | Enforced by / asserted under |
|---|---|---|
| *(none yet)* | | |

## Keeping specs true

Before changing code in an area, read that area's `requirements.md`. If the
change contradicts the spec, update the spec **in the same commit**. A behavior
change with no spec change is an incomplete change. The full gated workflow is in
[`AGENTS.md`](../../AGENTS.md).
